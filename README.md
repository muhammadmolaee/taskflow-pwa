## Project Overview

### Problem Statement

Modern life generates an overwhelming volume of tasks and responsibilities.
Existing to-do applications are either too complex or too simple. Individual
users need a lightweight, fast, installable task management application that
works on any device, functions offline, and provides meaningful organization
through categories and due dates — without requiring an account or internet
connectivity.

### Vision Statement

**FOR** individuals and professionals who need to manage daily tasks
**WHO** struggle with heavyweight apps and require offline access
**THE** TaskFlow PWA **IS A** progressive web application
**THAT** enables users to create, organize, prioritize, and complete tasks
across devices without internet dependency
**UNLIKE** Todoist or Notion
**OUR PRODUCT** delivers a zero-account, offline-first, installable experience

### Success Metrics

| Metric                | Target      | Status |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ------ |
| Initial load time     | < 2 seconds | ✅     |

## Lessons Learned

1. **Requirements first** — Writing requirements before coding prevented
   scope creep and kept the project focused.

2. **Offline-first design** — Building with IndexedDB from the start
   made offline support natural rather than an afterthought.

3. **Component modularity** — Small focused components made debugging
   and iteration much faster.

4. **CI/CD early** — Setting up GitHub Actions early meant every
   change was automatically deployed without manual effort.

5. **Pressman's process works** — Following a structured software
   engineering process produced a more complete and professional
   result than ad-hoc development.

## Methodology Justification

This project followed a **Hybrid Incremental-Agile** model as described
by Pressman. The structured phases (Communication → Planning → Modeling
→ Construction → Deployment) provided discipline and documentation,
while agile thinking within each phase allowed flexibility and iteration.

This was suitable because:

- The project was small enough for one developer
- Requirements were mostly known upfront
- Incremental delivery allowed testing at each stage
- The hybrid approach balanced documentation with speed
